# foundry_etherDynamicNft
A dynamic nft based on ether's current price

# Overview
  
  This contract uses chainlink automation to automate when the current image or nft flips
  to a different image. It changes based on the current price of eth. That is when eth price exceeds $3000 dollars dollars, the image changes to a different one.

# Test
 
  `forge test`

# Deployment

  It was deployed on ethereum sepolia chain. Feel free to change the images and deploy a new 
  instance
